@article{Lowe2004,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

To cater for image regions containing texture and isolated features, a combined corner and edge detector based on the local auto-correlation function is utilised, and it is shown to perform with good consistency on natural imagery.},

@article{Fermi,
abstract = {The lethal outcome of high-dose pulmonary virus infection is thought to reflect high-level, sustained virus replication and associated lung inflammation prior to development of an adaptive immune response. Herein, we demonstrate that the outcome of lethal/sublethal influenza infection instead correlates with the initial virus replication tempo. Furthermore, the magnitude of early lung antiviral CD8+ T cell responses varies inversely with inoculum dose and is controlled by lymph-node-resident dendritic cells (LNDC) through IL-12p40-regulated FasL-dependent T cell apoptosis. These results suggest that the inoculum dose and replication rate of a pathogen entering the respiratory tract may regulate the strength of the adaptive immune response, and the subsequent outcome of infection and that LNDC may serve as regulators (gatekeepers) in the development of CD8+ T cell responses.},
